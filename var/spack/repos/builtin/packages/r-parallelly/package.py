class RParallelly(RPackage):
    """Enhancing the 'parallel' Package

    Utility functions that enhance the 'parallel' package and support the
    built-in parallel backends of the 'future' package. For example,
    availableCores() gives the number of CPU cores available to your R process
    as given by the operating system, 'cgroups' and Linux containers, R
    options, and environment variables, including those set by job schedulers
    on high-performance compute clusters. If none is set, it will fall back to
    parallel::detectCores(). Another example is makeClusterPSOCK(), which is
    backward compatible with parallel::makePSOCKcluster() while doing a better
    job in setting up remote cluster workers without the need for configuring
    the firewall to do port-forwarding to your local computer."""
